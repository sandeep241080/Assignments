<p>Right - over to you. Close Tableau, if you already have it open, and let's create a couple of vizzes.</p><ol><li>Open Tableau, and connect to the Excel workbook "SourceDataf.xlsx", and the Excel spreadsheet "CDs".</li><li>Create a viz which shows a bar chart the smallest file size per "File Extension". (There are 3 File Extensions - I want the smallest file size for each of these file extensions.)Â </li><li>Create another viz which shows a line chart with Years and Quarters in the Columns shelf, and the Minimum of the "#" field in the Rows shelf.</li><li>Either save this viz to Tableau Public, or save it to your desktop (if you have Tableau Desktop or similar.)</li><li>Close Tableau completely, open it again, and open your newly saved file.</li></ol>
